# Real-Time Survey Ingestion – Talend Example

This example demonstrates a **real-time, API-based ingestion pattern**
implemented using Talend.

## Scenario
- External systems submit survey data via API
- Data is ingested and processed in near real-time
- Process supports dynamic structures and configurations

## Key Characteristics
- API-driven ingestion
- Reusable and generic flow
- Dynamic schema handling
- Centralized error handling
- Suitable for high-frequency data streams

## Purpose
This example is intentionally **small and focused**.
It demonstrates architectural thinking and integration patterns,
not full production code.

Screenshots may be added to illustrate:
- Job flow
- API configuration
- Error handling paths
