# 🧠 Data Engineering Foundations

This repository consolidates **foundational knowledge and hands-on experience**
in enterprise-grade data engineering environments.

The focus is not on a single tool, but on:
- Architecture & infrastructure
- End-to-end ETL / ELT processes
- Version control & deployment
- Operational stability & monitoring
- Database performance & optimization

This repository represents the **engineering foundations** behind modern data platforms
(ADF, Databricks, cloud-native pipelines, and GenAI systems).

## 🔹 What You'll Find Here
- Talend platform architecture in enterprise environments
- Integration of Talend with Git, Nexus, TAC, and Job Servers
- Development workflows and operational best practices
- A real-time API-based ETL example (Talend)
- SQL & Oracle foundations: performance, indexing, procedures

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository exists to demonstrate **system-level understanding**
and long-term engineering experience that supports more modern platforms.

It is intentionally **tool-agnostic in mindset**, even when examples use Talend.
