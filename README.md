# 🧠 Data Engineering Foundations

This repository consolidates **foundational knowledge and hands-on experience**
in enterprise-grade data engineering environments.

The focus is not on a single tool, but on:
- Architecture & infrastructure
- End-to-end ETL / ELT processes
- Version control & deployment
- Operational stability & monitoring
- Database performance & optimization

This repository represents the **engineering foundations** behind modern data platforms
(ADF, Databricks, cloud-native pipelines, and GenAI systems).
